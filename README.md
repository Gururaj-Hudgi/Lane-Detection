# Lane-Detection

This is a deep learning and computer vision project. This system helps to detect the lanes marked on the road so that driver can be aware whether his vehicle is in proper lane or not
This is developed using CNN neural Networks

For downloading the dataset zip file of this project please email me : gururajhudgi85@gmail.com

after downloading the datasets run the Full CNN.py file which developes the model and once model is ready run draw_detected_lanes.py file to get the output.

if you want to get output without training then download the above model adn directly run the draw_detected_lanes.py file.
